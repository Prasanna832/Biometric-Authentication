# Biometric-authentication
Note:final data set not uploaded as its too lrge 
This project focuses on biometric authentication using deep learning techniques, specifically iris recognition with CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks).

📌 Features

✅ Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for iris recognition.

✅ Processes image datasets for authentication.

✅ Implements deep learning models for classification.

✅ Built using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV.

🚀 How to Run the Project

1️⃣ Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python streamlit

2️⃣ Train the Model (Optional)

To train the biometric authentication model, run:

python train.py

3️⃣ Run the Authentication System

streamlit run app.py
